# Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction

Dataset contains monthly Yes bank stock price from July 2005 â€“ Nov 2020. It has following features

Date: Denotes month and year for particular price
Open: contains opening price of that month
High: contains Highest price of that month
Low: contains lowest price of that month
Close: contains closing price of that month


In this project ,I have used Regression models such as Linear Regression,Lasso Regression,Ridge Regression to predict the closing price.

Results:

1.We got a maximum accuracy of 82%.

2.Linear, lasso and ridge regression show almost same R squared values.

3.Whereas elastic net model shows lowest R squared value and high MSE, RMSE, MAE

4.Close, Open and high price of stock are strongly correlated with each other.
